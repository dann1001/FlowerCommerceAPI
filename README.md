# Flower Commerce API

## Overview

Flower Commerce API is a backend system built with ASP.NET Core that allows you to manage products, users, and authentication. The API supports JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and integrates with SQL Server for data storage.

### Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Supports user registration, login, password hashing, and role-based access control (Admin and User roles).
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products, including creating, updating, deleting, and fetching product details.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure endpoints using JWT tokens.
- **Database Integration**: Uses SQL Server for storing products and user data.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Provides interactive API documentation for testing and exploring the API.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 8.0
- **Database**: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI (via Swashbuckle)
- **Hashing**: Password hashing with `PasswordHasher` from ASP.NET Core Identity
- **Dependencies**:
  - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
  - `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`
  - `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` for Swagger documentation

## Prerequisites

1. **.NET 8.0 SDK** or later installed on your system.
2. **SQL Server**: You should have SQL Server installed or use a hosted SQL Server instance.
3. **Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio**: For development.
4. **Postman** or any other API client for testing the API.

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FlowerCommerceAPI.git
cd FlowerCommerceAPI
```
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Configure Database

In your `appsettings.json` file, update the connection string to point to your SQL Server instance:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server-name;Database=FlowerCommerce;Trusted_Connection=True;"
}
```

### 4. Apply Database Migrations

Ensure that the database is set up with the latest migrations. Run the following command:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### 5. JWT Settings Configuration

In your `appsettings.json`, configure the JWT settings:

```json
"JwtSettings": {
  "Issuer": "your-issuer",
  "Audience": "your-audience",
  "SecretKey": "your-very-secure-secret-key"
}
```

You may also want to add these JWT settings in environment variables for security reasons in production.

### 6. Run the API

You can now run the API locally:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 7. Swagger UI

The API includes Swagger UI for easy testing. You can access it by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:5000/swagger
```

## API Endpoints

### User Endpoints

- **POST /api/users/register** - Register a new user (Admin can register users).
- **POST /api/users/login** - User login (returns JWT token).
- **POST /api/users/logout** - User logout (invalidate the JWT token).

### Product Endpoints

- **GET /api/products** - List all products.
- **GET /api/products/{id}** - Get product by ID.
- **POST /api/products** - Create a new product (Admin only).
- **PUT /api/products/{id}** - Update a product (Admin only).
- **DELETE /api/products/{id}** - Delete a product (Admin only).

### Authentication

- **POST /api/auth/login** - User login (JWT token is returned).
- **POST /api/auth/refresh** - Refresh JWT token if expired.

## Testing the API

### 1. Register a User

Send a POST request to `POST /api/users/register` with a JSON body containing the user details:

```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "Password123"
}
```

### 2. Login

Send a POST request to `POST /api/auth/login` with the following credentials:

```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "password": "Password123"
}
```

You will receive a JWT token in response. Use this token for further authenticated requests.

### 3. Access Protected Endpoints

For protected endpoints (like creating or updating products), add the `Authorization` header with the Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your-jwt-token}
```

### Notes:

- Make sure to store sensitive data like JWT secret keys and connection strings securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secure secrets manager).
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or XSS.
