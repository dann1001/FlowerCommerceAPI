# FlowerCommerceAPI

FlowerCommerceAPI is a backend API built using ASP.NET Core for managing products and categories in an e-commerce platform. The API provides endpoints to handle product CRUD operations, and it supports JWT authentication for admin actions.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Create, read, update, and delete products.
- **Category Management**: Manage product categories.
- **Authentication**: Admin actions are restricted and require JWT authentication.
- **Image Storage**: Handles product images, stored locally.
- **Database**: Uses SQL Server with Entity Framework Core.

## API Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/products` - Get all products
- **GET** `/api/products/{id}` - Get a product by ID
- **POST** `/api/products` - Create a new product (Admin only)
- **PUT** `/api/products/{id}` - Update an existing product (Admin only)
- **DELETE** `/api/products/{id}` - Delete a product (Admin only)
