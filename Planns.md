# Backend Development Roadmap

## Context and Objective

The frontend UI for the project is already built, and the focus is now on completing the backend API and ensuring seamless integration with the frontend. This document outlines the development schedule and priorities for achieving this goal.

## Weekly Goals and Tasks

### **Week 1: API Core Development**

**Goals**: Establish the core functionality of the API.

- **API Endpoints**:
  - Finalize CRUD operations for **Products**: Ensure GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints are functional.
  - Implement **JWT Authentication**:
    - Secure endpoints with token-based authentication.
    - Enable login, registration, and role-based access (e.g., admin, user).
- **Product Features**:
  - Add filtering (e.g., by price, category) and sorting.
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Write tests for core endpoints and authentication flows.
  - Validate secure and stable functionality.

---

### **Week 2: Advanced Backend Features**

**Goals**: Build user-facing and admin features to complete the backend.

- **Cart API**:
  - Endpoints to add, update, and remove items from the cart.
- **Order Management**:
  - Functionality to place and track orders.
- **User Profile Management**:
  - Allow users to update profiles and view their order history.
- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests for cart, order, and profile management.

---

### **Week 3: Integration & Frontend Connection**

**Goals**: Connect the React frontend with the backend API for a functional system.

- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Test and connect API endpoints to frontend features (product listings, cart, user authentication).
  - Debug and verify API calls for accurate data flow.
- **Admin Panel**:
  - Integrate admin panel functionalities (e.g., product and order management).
  - Ensure role-based access control for admin features.

---

### **Week 4: API Enhancements & Deployment Preparation**

**Goals**: Make the backend robust and ready for production.

- **Security**:
  - Add rate limiting and account lockout for failed login attempts.
  - Ensure JWT token expiration and refresh mechanisms are reliable.
- **Deployment Setup**:
  - Prepare the API for deployment with production-ready configurations:
    - Secure endpoints using HTTPS.
    - Configure custom domains.
- **Database Optimization**:
  - Verify migrations and create necessary indexes.
  - Test database connectivity for cloud hosting and optimize queries.

---

### **Week 5: CI/CD and Post-Deployment Testing**

**Goals**: Automate and streamline deployment workflows.

- **CI/CD**:
  - Use tools like GitHub Actions for automated builds, testing, and deployments.
- **Final Testing**:
  - Perform end-to-end tests between frontend and backend.
  - Validate the complete user flow from browsing to order placement.
- **Deployment**:
  - Deploy the API on a hosting service (e.g., IIS, Azure App Services).
  - Monitor and fix post-deployment issues.

---

### **Week 6: Post-Launch Enhancements**

**Goals**: Improve functionality and add advanced features.

- **Feedback and Analytics**:
  - Set up monitoring tools for API usage.
  - Collect user and admin feedback.
- **Payment Gateway**:
  - Integrate payment systems like Stripe or PayPal.
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Explore enhancements like AI recommendations or additional localization.

---

## Key Recommendations

- **Frontend-Backend Communication**: Align API responses with frontend requirements, prioritizing critical functionalities like product details and authentication.
- **Testing Focus**: Emphasize unit and integration tests for smooth integration and reliable performance.
- **Early Deployment**: Use a staging environment for iterative testing and real-world feedback.
